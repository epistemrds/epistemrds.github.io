## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/epistemrds/epistemrds.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

For more features, we can use the flavor [Kramdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org "hp").
Here is the Kramdown [quickref](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html)
Use $$ as delimiters to enable TeX math mode, both for inline and display (i.e. block) rendering.

### Support for MathJax
Here is an example equation that is inline: $$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$, where $$a$$, $$b$$, and $$c$$ are variables.

Here is a block rendering with no default equation numbering:

$$ \frac{1}{n^{2}} $$

And, below is a block using the \begin{equation} and \end{equation} LaTeX delimiters. This equation will be numbered in the ams and all setting for mathjax.tags.

$$ \begin{equation} \mathbf{X}{n,p} = \mathbf{A}{n,k} \mathbf{B}_{k,p} \label{test} \end{equation} $$

If equation numbering is turned on, we should see an equation number here: $$\eqref{test}$$.

An example using the {align} LaTeX environment is below. The first equation has a \notag directive.

$$ \begin{align} (x + y) (x - y) &= x^2 + xy - xy + y^2 \notag \ &= x^2 - y^2 \end{align} $$

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/epistemrds/epistemrds.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
